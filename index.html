	<body> <p>welcome to my website- there is absoloutely nothing here. so feel free to look around. At nothing. </p>

	<p>I am hoping to put the following here somewhere:</p>
	<ol><li>a blog -hopefully occasionally updating with some programming related things that I'm doing. There's a fair chance this will happen, like, every three years</li><li>I haven't really thought about anything else that will be good for this. Maybe I could just put clip art everywhere. Everyone likes that, right?</li>
